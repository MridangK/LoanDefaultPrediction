# Loan Default Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for predicting loan defaults. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a borrower will default on their loan or not. The model can help lenders assess the risk associated with lending money to individuals or businesses.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle which consists of historical loan data including various features such as borrower information, loan amount, interest rate, employment details, credit history, etc. The dataset is divided into two parts: a training set and a test set.

## Methodology

The loan default prediction model is built using a supervised learning approach. The following steps are typically involved in the process:

1. Data preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset, handling missing values, categorical encoding, feature scaling, etc.

2. Feature selection: Identifying the most relevant features that have a significant impact on loan default prediction.

3. Model selection: Exploring and comparing different machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, etc., to determine the most suitable model.

4. Model training: Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets, training the selected model on the training set, and tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.

5. Model evaluation: Assessing the trained model's performance on the test set using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curves.

6. Deployment: Once a satisfactory model is obtained, it can be deployed in a production environment to make real-time loan default predictions.
